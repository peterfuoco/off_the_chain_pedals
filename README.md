This project utilizes MVC architecture and js, html, and css in order to dynamically render user input based on guitar pedals. Seed data is provided in the pro_pedals route as a reference for users. The app has create, read, update, and delete functionality for user input in the 'pedals' route. The second controller, Guitarists, has an index and show page in order to provide basic information for users to reference before returning to the pedals route.
#

Next steps include additional styling, dynamically rendering guitar pedal images corresponding to user input (ie a reverb pedal when a user creates one), as well as functionality to inform users when their guitar pedal chain follows protocol.
