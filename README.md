#This project utilizes MVC architecture and js, html, and css in order to dynamically render user input based on guitar pedals. Seed data is provided in the pro_pedals route as a reference for users. 
#

#Next steps include additional styling, dynamically rendering guitar pedal images corresponding to user input (ie a reverb pedal when a user creates one), as well as functionality to inform users when their guitar pedal chain follows protocol.
